# Self-Hosted vs. Cloud

GenFeed is available as an open source core (self-hosted) and a fully managed cloud platform. Here's how to decide.

## Comparison

| | Self-Hosted (Core) | GenFeed Cloud |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | You manage infrastructure | Instant — sign up and start |
| **Cost** | Your compute + API costs | Subscription (free tier available) |
| **Image generation** | Yes | Yes |
| **Video generation** | Yes | Yes |
| **Brand kits** | Yes | Yes |
| **Model selection** | Full control (any model) | Curated best models |
| **Multi-tenancy** | No | Yes — manage multiple brands |
| **Publisher** | No | Yes — auto-post to X, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube |
| **Analytics** | No | Yes — engagement, revenue per post |
| **Team collaboration** | No | Yes — roles, approvals, workspaces |
| **Manager (templates, ingredients)** | No | Yes |
| **Studio (full editor)** | No | Yes |
| **Marketplace** | No | Yes — prompts, workflows, brand kits |
| **API** | Yes (REST) | Yes (REST + SDK) |
| **Webhooks** | Yes | Yes |
| **NSFW content** | Yes (your models) | SFW only |
| **Support** | Community (GitHub) | Priority support + SLA |
| **Updates** | Manual (git pull) | Automatic |
| **License** | AGPL-3.0 | Commercial |

## When to Self-Host

Self-hosting is right for you if:

- You need **NSFW content support** (bring your own models)
- You want **full control** over models, data, and infrastructure
- You're a developer who prefers to run their own stack
- You have existing infrastructure (Kubernetes, Docker, etc.)
- You need to keep data on-premises for compliance

## When to Use Cloud

GenFeed Cloud is right for you if:

- You want to **start generating content immediately**
- You need **multi-brand management** (agencies, teams)
- You want **auto-publishing** to social platforms
- You need **analytics and performance tracking**
- You want a **collaborative workspace** for your team
- You prefer **managed infrastructure** with zero DevOps

## Cost Comparison

### Self-Hosted
- **Infrastructure:** $20-100/month (VPS or cloud server)
- **AI API costs:** Variable (Replicate ~$0.003-0.05/image, fal.ai similar)
- **Your time:** Setup, maintenance, updates, monitoring

### Cloud
- **Subscription:** Free tier available, paid plans from $29/month
- **Per-use pricing:** Images and video billed per asset
- **Your time:** Zero infrastructure management

<Callout type="info">
**The math:** If you generate fewer than 500 images/month, Cloud is more cost-effective when you factor in infrastructure and maintenance time. Above 500/month, self-hosting saves money — but you lose Publisher, Analytics, and multi-tenancy.
</Callout>

## Migration Path

Start with either option — migration is straightforward:

**Core → Cloud:** Export your brand kits and templates, import into Cloud. Your content and settings transfer.

**Cloud → Core:** Export your configuration. Self-host with the same brand kits and generation settings.
