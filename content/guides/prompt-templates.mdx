## Product Shot

Place your product naturally into any scene with matching lighting and shadows.

**Template:**

```
Place [YOUR_PRODUCT] in [SCENE_DESCRIPTION]. Match the [LIGHTING_TYPE] lighting from the scene. Position the product at [ANGLE/POSITION] showing [KEY_FEATURES]. Add [ENVIRONMENTAL_DETAILS] and soft shadows that match the lighting direction. The final image should look like [DESIRED_OUTCOME].
```

**Example:**

```
Place the Nike shoe in the desert sand dunes. Match the warm golden hour lighting from the scene. Position the product at a dynamic angle showing the sole and side profile. Add subtle sand particles around the shoe and soft shadows that match the lighting direction. The final image should look like a professional outdoor product shoot.
```

## Model + Product

Combine a model with your product for lifestyle and fashion shots.

**Template:**

```
Create a [PHOTOGRAPHY_STYLE] advertisement showing [MODEL_DESCRIPTION] wearing/using [YOUR_PRODUCT]. The model should be in a [POSE_DESCRIPTION] with the product [PRODUCT_PLACEMENT]. Use [BACKGROUND_DESCRIPTION] as the background. Match the lighting to create a [MOOD] shot. The result should look like [CAMPAIGN_STYLE].
```

**Example:**

```
Create a fashion advertisement showing the model wearing the Ray-Ban sunglasses. The model should be in a confident, stylish pose with the sunglasses naturally positioned. Use the urban street scene as the background. Match the lighting to create a cohesive lifestyle shot. The result should look like a high-end eyewear campaign photo.
```

## Color Variations

Generate product colorways inspired by reference images.

**Template:**

```
Create a new version of [YOUR_PRODUCT] using the [COLOR_STYLE] color palette from the reference images. Apply a [APPLICATION_STYLE] design inspired by these colors. Keep the [PRESERVED_FEATURES] intact. The result should look like [PRODUCT_LINE_DESCRIPTION].
```

**Example:**

```
Create a new version of the Apple Watch using the vibrant color palette from the paint and pastel reference images. Apply a gradient or color-blocked design inspired by these colors. Keep the watch's shape, screen, and details intact. The result should look like a special edition colorway that could be part of a product line expansion.
```

## Background Swap

Replace backgrounds while maintaining natural lighting and blending.

**Template:**

```
Place [YOUR_SUBJECT] in front of [NEW_BACKGROUND]. Adjust the lighting on the subject to match the [LIGHTING_QUALITY] in the background scene. Position the subject [POSITIONING_INSTRUCTION]. Ensure [BLENDING_REQUIREMENTS] throughout the composite.
```

**Example:**

```
Place the model in front of the colorful wall background. Adjust the lighting on the subject to match the soft, diffused light in the background scene. Position the subject naturally as if they were photographed in this location. Ensure smooth edge blending and consistent color temperature throughout the composite.
```

## Style Transfer

Transform images into different artistic styles.

**Template:**

```
Transform [YOUR_IMAGE] into a [TARGET_STYLE], matching [STYLE_REFERENCE_DESCRIPTION]. [ADDITIONAL_INSTRUCTIONS].
```

**Example:**

```
Transform the uploaded owl photo into a soft watercolor children's book illustration, matching a delicate hand-painted storybook style. Show me only the owl with no background.
```

## Scene Composite

Blend elements from multiple images into a cohesive scene.

**Template:**

```
Create a new [SCENE_TYPE] that combines [ELEMENTS_FROM_IMAGE_1] with [ELEMENTS_FROM_IMAGE_2]. Imagine [CREATIVE_CONCEPT]. [SPECIFIC_DETAILS]. Unify the lighting to suggest [TIME_OF_DAY/ATMOSPHERE].
```

**Example:**

```
Create a new urban scene that combines the architectural elements from the NY street views with the greenery and plants from the green wall reference. Imagine a futuristic eco-city where nature has reclaimed urban spaces. Vines and plants grow on building facades, green walls line the streets, but the classic architecture remains visible. Unify the lighting to suggest late afternoon golden hour.
```

## Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific with lighting**: Mention light direction, quality (soft/hard), and color temperature
- **Include material details**: Specify textures like matte, glossy, metallic, or fabric types
- **Define the outcome**: Describe what the final image should look like (campaign photo, product shot, editorial)
- **Match reference context**: When using reference images, describe what elements to pull from each
- **Keep placeholders actionable**: Replace every `[PLACEHOLDER]` before generating
