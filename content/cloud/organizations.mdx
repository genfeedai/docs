# Organizations

Multi-tenant workspaces for agencies, teams, and enterprises.

## What Are Organizations?

Organizations are isolated workspaces in Genfeed Cloud. Each organization has its own:

- Brands and brand kits
- Team members and permissions
- Assets and projects
- Billing and usage

## Use Cases

### Agencies

Create an organization for each client:

- Client A → Organization A
- Client B → Organization B
- Keep data completely separate
- Invite clients to their own workspace

### Enterprises

Departments or business units:

- Marketing → Marketing Org
- Sales → Sales Org
- Product → Product Org

### Teams

Single organization with team collaboration:

- One org for your company
- Multiple brands within that org
- Team members with different roles

## Creating an Organization

1. Go to **Settings → Organizations**
2. Click **New Organization**
3. Enter name and details
4. Invite team members

## Switching Organizations

Use the organization switcher in the top-left corner to jump between workspaces.

Keyboard shortcut: `Cmd/Ctrl + K` then type org name.
