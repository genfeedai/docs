## What Is a Brand Kit?

A brand kit defines your brand's visual and verbal identity:

- **Visual** — Logo, colors, fonts
- **Voice** — How your brand speaks
- **Tone** — Mood and style variations
- **Guidelines** — Rules for the AI

## Creating a Brand

2. Click **New Brand**
3. Fill in brand details
