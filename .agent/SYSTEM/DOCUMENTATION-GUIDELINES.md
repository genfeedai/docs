# Documentation Guidelines

**Project:** docs.genfeed.ai  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27

## Purpose

This document defines what should and should NOT be documented in the Genfeed user documentation site.

## Scope of Documentation

### ✅ DO Document (User-Facing Apps)

**Focus on helping users use the platform and improve their prompting:**

1. **Studio App** - Content generation workspace
2. **Manager App** - Content organization and management
3. **Publisher App** - Scheduling and publishing
4. **Analytics App** - Performance tracking and insights
5. **Automation App** - Workflow automation
6. **Dashboard App** - Organization overview and management

### ❌ DO NOT Document

**These apps are excluded from user documentation:**

1. **Login App** - Authentication flows (internal/technical, not user-facing)
2. **Admin App** - Internal administration tools (not for end users)
3. **Stock App** - Not launched yet, not publicly available

**Rationale:**

- **Login App**: Authentication is handled automatically, users don't need documentation
- **Admin App**: Internal tooling for platform administrators, not end users
- **Stock App**: Not yet launched, documenting would be premature

## Documentation Focus

## When in Doubt

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Is this for end users?** If no, don't document
2. **Will this help users create better content?** If no, reconsider
3. **Is this feature publicly available?** If no, don't document
4. **Does this improve user prompting?** If yes, document it

**If unsure, check:**

- Is the feature in Studio, Manager, Publisher, Analytics, Automation, or Dashboard?
- Is it accessible to regular users (not admins)?
- Is it publicly launched?

**If all yes → Document it**  
**If any no → Don't document it**

## Examples

### ✅ Good Documentation Topics

- "How to generate videos in Studio"
- "Using the thread composer in Publisher"
- "Setting up link tracking in Analytics"
- "Creating workflows in Automation"
- "Model selection guide for better results"
- "Prompting techniques for articles"

### ❌ Bad Documentation Topics

- "How to log in" (automatic, no docs needed)
- "Admin user management" (not for end users)
- "Stock marketplace features" (not launched)
- "API authentication" (developer docs, not user docs)
- "Internal workflows" (not user-facing)

## Enforcement

**Before creating new documentation:**

1. Check this guidelines document
2. Verify feature is user-facing
3. Confirm feature is publicly available
4. Ensure it helps users use the platform

**Before updating existing documentation:**

1. Verify content aligns with guidelines
2. Remove any admin/internal content
3. Focus on user value
4. Improve prompting guidance

---

**Remember:** This is **user documentation** to help people **use the app** and **prompt better**. Not developer docs, not admin docs, not unreleased features.
